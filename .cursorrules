Peace Piece Project Overview:

Core Architecture: iOS SwiftUI application with a 4×4 grid of interactive MIDI pads. Each pad transitions through three states (.initial → .cued → .playing) and triggers unique MIDI notes. It utilizes the AudioKit dependecy framework from GitHub.

Key Components:
- Conductor: Central controller managing AudioKit engine, MIDI events, state transitions, and audio playback.
- PadViewModel: Handles state logic for individual pads with proper state progression.
- PadView: Visual representation with color-coded states (gray, orange, green) and drag gesture detection.
- ContentView: Main UI layout organizing the 4×4 grid structure.

State Management Rules:
- Only one pad can be .cued or .playing per column at any time.
- User interactions trigger .initial → .cued transitions.
- Bar line events trigger .cued → .playing transitions.
- Each pad plays a unique MIDI note (36-51) when in .playing state.
- Playing notes loop until replaced by another pad in the same column.

Technical Implementation:
- AudioKit/AudioKitEX for sound generation and MIDI handling.
- AppleSequencer for timing and bar line detection (4-beat intervals).
- MIDISampler for sound generation.
- Column-based state management for pad transitions.

SwiftUI Project structure: 

The main folder contains a "Sources" folder with "App" for main files, "Views" divided into "Home" and "Profile" sections with their ViewModels, and "Shared" for reusable components and modifiers. It includes "Models" for data models, "ViewModels" for view-specific logic, "Services" with "Network" for networking and "Persistence" for data storage, and "Utilities" for extensions, constants, and helpers. The "Resources" folder holds "Assets" for images and colors, "Localization" for localized strings, and "Fonts" for custom fonts. Lastly, the "Tests" folder includes "UnitTests" for unit testing and "UITests" for UI testing.

SwiftUI UI Design Rules:

Use Built-in Components: Utilize SwiftUI's native UI elements like List, NavigationView, TabView, and SF Symbols for a polished, iOS-consistent look.

Master Layout Tools: Employ VStack, HStack, ZStack, Spacer, and Padding for responsive designs; use LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid for grids; GeometryReader for dynamic layouts.

Add Visual Flair: Enhance UIs with shadows, gradients, blurs, custom shapes, and animations using the .animation() modifier for smooth transitions.

Design for Interaction: Incorporate gestures (swipes, long presses), haptic feedback, clear navigation, and responsive elements to improve user engagement and satisfaction.
